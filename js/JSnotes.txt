MUST USE `;` AT THE END OF EVERY LINE
Print in console use --> console.log("hello world") 
Var --> let "var name" = "the actual thing you want the var to be valued with"

re-assigning happens when :
    `let age = 11
    console.log(age)
    age = 54
    console.log(age)`
first `let age = 11` sets the word "age" as a varuable, so that you don't have to use `let` again.
for you to fix a var you use `const` instead of `let` therfore the var will have a fixed value and when changing it with `var = ` it will show an error.
there is a var tha is called `var` works like `let` but is'nt longer used, but you can find it in onled code

Number objects and numbers:

nubmer can == and === each other propely 
`
ley y = 500;
let x = 500;
let z = new Number(500);
let a = new Number(500);

x == z; // true
x === z; // false

x == y; // true
x ===y; // false

z == a; //false
z === a; //true
`

math works noramlly between number X number and object X number, BUT math doesn't math with object X object it will always be flase in case of ==
