get commit -m "commit here"

In css we do multi class/id styling like this:
.class1, class2, id3 {
    whatever they have: inCommon;
}


<!-- in the inspect element -->
Ctrl + F to search
Esc to open concole, $0 to edit the selected line.
dir ($0) to viwe in opject format
viwe pervious notes $1

<!-- Padding, margin, and border -->
padding increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.
border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
margin increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.
