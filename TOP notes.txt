In css we do multi class/id styling like this:
.class1, class2, id3 {
    whatever they have: inCommon;
}


<!-- in the inspect element -->
Ctrl + F to search
Esc to open concole, $0 to edit the selected line.
dir ($0) to viwe in opject format
viwe pervious notes $1

<!-- Padding, margin, and border -->
padding increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.
border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
margin increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.
Collapse margins work only with margins taht are on top of each other (line 29:37 boxStyle) ending up total margins = biggest margin value

<!--  box-sizing: border-box vs  box-sizing: content-box --> (line 21:37 boxStyle)
box-sizing: border-box; 
This forces the browser to display he contents as the width and height state
border-box will make the element the set size you sit it to adding padding won't add to the overall size of the element
if width 700 and height 500 
border box means that that the whole element's max dimensions will be 700*500
if content box means that only the content will be 700*500 anything else will increases the dimensions

<!-- Negative margins --> (line 39:41 boxStyle | line 22:25 boxModel)
they pull stuff closer instead of making room

<!-- Flex grow and shirnk -->
Flex is a shorthand for Flex-grow/shrink/basis
Flex: 1; = Flex 1/1/0
`flex: ;` is only for child while `display: flex;` is for parent

Grow html line 10-15 & css line 7-20

shrink html line 17-22 & css line 22-24 
shrinks element equally to fit the container if 1
if shrink value = 0 it won't shrink
if shrink value > 0 it will shrink more 

flex basis is when will the shrink and grow start, if 0 then as soon as you type, if auto it will be the set height/width you set.
